To compile the code, please, run make in this directorty.

To run the program, simply execute ./hw2_histogram (INPUT_LENGTH) (DISTRIBUTION_TYPE)

The program has 2 parameters:
- INPUT_LENGTH: Length of the input random array
- DISTRIBUTION_TYPE: Type of distribution to be used. 1 denotes Uniform Distribution while 2 denotes Normal Distribution.

If none of these paramters are provided, then the program will use a default input length of 1048576 with a Normal Distribution

The program outputs a csv file with the resulting histogram computation.
